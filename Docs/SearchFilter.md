## Occurrence status filter
This filter will return observations with occurrenceStatus "present"
```json
{
    "occurrenceStatus": "present"
}
```

This filter will return observations with occurrenceStatus "absent"
```json
{
    "occurrenceStatus": "absent"
}
```

## Verification status filter
This filter will return only verified observations.
```json
{
    "verificationStatus": "Verified"
}
```

This filter will return only non verified observations.
```json
{
    "verificationStatus": "NotVerified"
}
```

## Determination filter
This filter will only return observations where `observation.identification.uncertainIdentification=false`.
```json
{
    "determinationFilter": "NotUnsureDetermination"
}
```

This filter will only return observations where `observation.identification.uncertainIdentification=true`.
```json
{
    "determinationFilter": "OnlyUnsureDetermination"
}
```

## NotRecovered filter
This filter will only return observations where `observation.occurrence.isNotRediscoveredObservation=false`.
```json
{
    "notRecoveredFilter": "DontIncludeNotRecovered"
}
```

This filter will only return observations where `observation.occurrence.isNotRediscoveredObservation=true`. About 230k observations.
```json
{
    "notRecoveredFilter": "OnlyNotRecovered"
}
```

Don't apply this filter (default)
```json
{
    "notRecoveredFilter": "NoFilter"
}
```

`occurrence.isNotRediscoveredObservation` - *Indicates if this observation is a not rediscovered observation. "Not rediscovered observation" is an observation that says that the specified species was not found in a location where it has previously been observed.*

## BirdNestActivityLimit filter
This filter returns observations where `observation.occurrence.birdNestActivityId` is lower than or equal to the filter value.
```json
{
    "birdNestActivityLimit": 10
}
```

## ReportedByMe filter
This filter returns observations that are reported by the user specified in the authorization access token.
```json
{
    "reportedByMe": true
}
```

## ObservedByMe filter
This filter returns observations that are observed by the user specified in the authorization access token.
```json
{
    "reportedByMe": true
}
```

## Output
With output you can specify which fields that should be included in the result. The default is the `Minimum` field set (the 22 most important fields). Fields with null value are never returned.

### fieldSet
There are four predefined field sets to choose from: [Minimum](FieldSets.md#Minimum), [Extended](FieldSets.md#Extended), [AllWithValues](FieldSets.md#AllWithValues) and [All](FieldSets.md#All). They are described on the [FieldSet documentation page](FieldSets.md)

This filter will return all fields defined in the [Extended](FieldSets.md#Extended) field set.
```json
{
    "output": {
       "fieldSet": "Extended"
    }
}
```

### fields
With fields you can specify which additional fields that should be included in the result.

This filter will return all fields defined in the [Minimum](FieldSets.md#Minimum) field set and also the fields `location.province`, `location.parish`
```json
{
    "output": {
       "fieldSet": "Minimum",
       "fields": ["location.province", "location.parish"]
    }
}
```

If you specify `fields` without specifying `fieldSet`, you will retrieve only the specified fields.
