## Basics
Regardless of whether you are developing a web, mobile, or desktop solution, it is best practice to communicate with SOS through a dedicated backend rather than accessing the API directly from the web browser or phone app. This way, you only need to make changes in one place, the App Backend, if there are structural changes in the SOS API.

  App Backend-->>App: Observations
```


## Case sensitivity
Use **case-insensitive** deserialization when handling JSON data from SOS. This prevents errors that can be difficult to identify.
```csharp
var jsonSerializerOptions = new JsonSerializerOptions {
  PropertyNameCaseInsensitive = true
};
```


## Null values

### Requests
Instead of setting JSON properties to `null` or an empty object/array, you can omit the property entirely. This reduces the amount of data being sent and simplifies troubleshooting, as it becomes easier to identify the relevant parts..

### Responses
The SOS API uses `DefaultIgnoreCondition = JsonIgnoreCondition.Never`, meaning nullable properties will be serialized as `null` (with some exceptions explained below).
```csharp
var jsonSerializerOptions = new JsonSerializerOptions {
  DefaultIgnoreCondition = JsonIgnoreCondition.Never,
  PropertyNameCaseInsensitive = true  
};
```

**Example**
```json
{
  "propertyWithValue": "My value",
  "propertyWithoutValue": null
}
```

**Client robustness**<br/>
If you anticipate retrieving a nullable property but find that the property is absent in the JSON result, it is recommended to treat the value as `null`.


### Observation endpoints
The SOS system uses **Elasticsearch** as search database for Observations, Events and Datasets. Elasticsearch doesn't store null values, and since the SOS API allows you to specify what fields you want to return, properties with null values will be omitted in the response.

**Request**
`POST /Observations/Search`
```json
{
  "output": {
    "fields": ["event.startDate", "event.plainStartDate", "event.plainStartTime"]
  }
}
```

**Response - When the nullable field *plainStartTime* contains a value**
```json
{
  "event": {
    "startDate": "2017-04-25T18:35:00+02:00",	  
    "plainStartDate": "2017-04-25",	  
    "plainStartTime": "18:35"  
  }
}
```

**Response - When the nullable field *plainStartTime* is null**
```json
{
  "event": {
    "startDate": "2017-04-25T00:00:00+02:00",	  
    "plainStartDate": "2017-04-25"	  
  }
}
```

### Export endpoints
When exporting observations to CSV, Excel and GeoJSON a [flat observation](FlatObservation.md) structure will be used in where `null` values will be included by default.

**Request**
`POST Exports/Download/GeoJSON`
```json
{
  "output": {
    "fields": ["event.startDate", "event.plainStartDate", "event.plainStartTime"]
  }
}
```

**Response**
```json
{
  "properties": {
    "StartDate": "2017-04-25T00:00:00+02:00",	  
    "PlainStartDate": "2017-04-25",
    "PlainStartTime": null
}
```

**Request with excludeNullValues=true**<br/>
Explicitly exclude null values<br/>
`POST Exports/Download/GeoJSON?excludeNullValues=true`
```json
{
  "output": {
    "fields": ["event.startDate", "event.plainStartDate", "event.plainStartTime"]
  }
}
```

**Response**
```json
{
  "properties": {
    "StartDate": "2017-04-25T00:00:00+02:00",	  
    "PlainStartDate": "2017-04-25"    
}
```


## Custom Headers
When calling SOS, you can include certain values in the request headers. In many cases, this is not necessary, but for certain functionality, it is required to include correct information, and in other cases, it simplifies troubleshooting, for example. Below, you can read about different values that can be included in your requests.

### X-Requesting-System
In this header, you specify the system that is making the call to SOS. With this information, it becomes easier for us to assist you in troubleshooting if you encounter any issues with a query.

### X-Authorization-Application-Identifier
If you have authorization associated with a specific application within SLU, you can specify it here so that the returned data is based on the permissions you have in the respective application.

### X-Authorization-Role-Id
If you have authorization associated with a role in SLU's authorization system, you provide the ID of the role so that the returned data reflects the permissions of that role.

### X-Api-Version
This header is for future version control of SOS. You don't need to specify any value for now.

## Standard headers

### X-Forwarded-Proto
If you include the `X-Forwarded-Proto` header with the value `http`, the request will be rejected with a `308 Permanent Redirect` response. This ensures that all communication with the SOS API is performed over HTTPS. If you encounter this response, make sure that your client is using HTTPS when making requests to the API.



## Resources
The SOS API is divided into different resource groups to group related functionality. Currently, the following resource groups are available.

### Areas
Areas are used to define different geographical regions. Municipality, county, and parish are examples of different areas used by SOS.

### DataProviders
Information about different data providers and datasets for SOS can be found under DataProviders.

### Environment
Environment describes the current environment in which SOS is operated.

### Exports
SOS is a REST API and is not intended to be used as a data source for bulk downloads. If you are interested in large data sets, we recommend using exports. There are pre-built datasets available in DwC-A format for all DataProviders, and you can also define custom queries to download larger datasets in various formats. Currently, you can directly generate files with up to 100,000 observations. If you need more data, you can request files with up to 2,000,000 observations.

### Jobs
When placing a file order, you receive a job ID. This ID can be used to check the status of the job that generates the file.

### Locations
Information about occurrence locations can be found under Locations.

### Observations
Occurrence related data is found under Observations. Here, you can search for occurrences or use any of the available aggregated resources.

#### Filter
Some resources allow you to specify which fields you want to retrieve. You can specify a predefined field set (fieldset) (see more under Vocabularies below), or you can also specify exactly what you want to retrieve. By using this functionality, you minimize network traffic and optimize query performance. When specifying the fields you want to return, it's important to use the same format as they are returned. For example, if you want to return the start date of an observation, you would specify "event.startDate" in the output.fields. It is possible to specify a fieldset and supplement it with individual fields.

### Systems
If you want to know more about when the SOS database was last updated or how many observations are in the database, this is where you should look.

### TaxonLists
Lists of red-listed species, indicator species, or other groupings can be found under TaxonLists. The IDs of the lists can be used in certain searches.

### User
If you include a Bearer Authentication token in your requests, you can use this resource to see the roles and permissions of the user.

### Vocabularies
Swedish and English are the languages supported by SOS for metadata currently. The vocabulary used by SOS can be downloaded here. There are also resources available to display project information and more regarding the field sets that can be used in SOS.

## Versioning
Managing multiple versions of an API is complex and costly, so we strive to make all changes backward compatible. We follow [DIGG's guidelines](https://dev.dataportal.se/rest-api-profil/versionhantering) on what is considered backward compatible changes.

*An API should, as far as possible, have a loose coupling between the producer and the consumer. Therefore, backward compatibility is an important aspect of an API. With a backward-compatible API, changes can be made to the API without affecting the consumer of the API.*

*The following are examples of types of changes considered backward-compatible:*
- *Addition of a new optional field to a representation.*
- *Addition of a new resource for an API.*
- *Addition of a new optional search parameter.*
- *Additional support for media types.*
- *Removal of non-mandatory fields from representations.*

*The following are examples of types of changes considered non-backward-compatible:*
- *Removal of mandatory fields from representations.*
- *Change of data type for a field.*
- *Removal of resources or operations.*
- *Removal of support for media types.*

*As a producer of an API, one SHOULD avoid introducing non-backward compatible changes in their API, although sometimes it is unavoidable. As a consumer, one SHOULD always be tolerant, expect, and handle unexpected responses in a message. This creates robustness.*

## Data ingestion
- Most datasets are harvested and processed once a day. 
- Some datasets are rarely updated and harvested only when they have changed.
- The Artportalen database is harvested, in addition to once daily, also incrementally every 5 minutes. In other words, it takes at most 5 minutes before an Artportalen observation is available in SOS.
